# ACM YorkU Programming Contest 1 :boom:

The solutions for the questions are for the first round of the YorkU ACM programming contest, which can be found [here](https://open.kattis.com/contests/iurjfr)


## Thoughts :question:
It has been a while since my last programming contest. No idea why, but it took me an hour and a half to finish one question, and I was not able to solve any other questions in the alloted time. To be fair, it was a slight disappointment to myself because I know I am capable of more but I was not able to do so.

*However* :feet:

I am nowhere near discouraged, and am still excited about programming and competing in programming contests. It was a good learning experience and just tells me that there is so much for me to learn and I am very motivated to do so.
